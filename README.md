# Sub-Sentence-Encoder
The official code repo for "Sub-Sentence Encoder: Contrastive Learning of Propositional Semantic Representations".

Contrary to sentence embeddings, where the meaning of each sentence is represented by one fixed-length vector, sub-sentence-encoder produces distinct embeddings for different parts of a sentence.  

⚠️ WIP; We are working on migrating the model to a huggingface-compatible format

## Installation
The model is implemented with `pytorch_lightning==1.8.5` . See `requirements.txt` for the list of required packages.

## Usage
TBA
